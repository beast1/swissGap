                            Trade Verse is an innovative trading platform that enables you to buy and sell a variety of
                            financial assets, including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Our aim is to provide a
                            reliable and user-friendly service, but it's important to recognize the inherent risks
                            involved in trading.
                            <br/>When using Trade Verse, it is crucial that you take full responsibility for your
                            financial decisions. We cannot be held accountable for any losses you may incur. Before
                            engaging in any trades, it is essential to thoroughly assess your financial situation and
                            objectives. If needed, consult a qualified financial advisor to ensure informed
                            decision-making.
                            <br/>Please be aware that Trade Verse does not offer investment advice or recommendations, and

                            and market conditions can change rapidly and unexpectedly.
                            <br/>Furthermore, while we strive to maintain a smooth-running platform, Trade Verse may
                            experience occasional system downtime, outages, or technical issues that could hinder your
                            trading activity or access to your account. Although we make every effort to provide
                            continuous and error-free service, we cannot guarantee it.
                            <br/>By using the Trade Verse platform, you agree to indemnify and hold us, as well as our
